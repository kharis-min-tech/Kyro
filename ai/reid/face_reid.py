Kyro — Multi-Signal Person Re-Identification (local-only, short-retention)

Purpose: when someone briefly leaves frame (e.g. a toilet break) and the
tracker assigns a new track_id when they return, this module recognises
"this is the same person" so the pipeline can treat it as a returning
person instead of counting a new entry.

HISTORY: v1 used only a face embedding (Haar cascade + LBP histogram).
Real-world testing showed this essentially never fired — Haar cascades
need a clean, front-on, well-lit face that a typical room camera often
just doesn't get. v2 switched to clothing-colour appearance as the sole
primary signal. This version (v3) is a genuine multi-signal fusion, per
the brief: instead of asking a single yes/no question ("same clothes?"),
it asks "how likely is this the same person, given everything we can
observe?" — combining independent signals, weighted by how reliable each
one is, and refusing to merge identities unless the combined evidence
clears a high bar.

SIGNALS COMBINED (each contributes only when actually available):
  1. Clothing/appearance — HSV colour histogram of the torso region.
     Always available (needs only a valid bounding box). Primary signal.
  2. Body shape/proportions — a HOG (histogram of oriented gradients)
     descriptor of the whole-body silhouette, capturing build/posture/
     proportions independent of colour. Always available.
  3. Face embedding — LBP histogram of a detected face crop. Only
     available when a face is actually captured; used as a confidence
     boost, never required.
  4. Deep person-reid embedding (OPTIONAL) — if a .onnx re-id model
     (e.g. an OSNet export) is present at `deep_model_path`, it's loaded
     via OpenCV's DNN module (no PyTorch dependency) and its output
     vector is treated as a high-confidence signal. Skipped entirely if
     no model file is configured — see DeepReIdConfig docstring for where
     to get one. This is genuinely optional infrastructure, not a
     "pretend" feature: it does real inference when a model is present.
  5. Spatial-temporal plausibility — NOT a visual signal. Given the last
     place/time a candidate identity was seen, and the place/time of this
     new sighting, computes how physically plausible it is that these are
     the same person: reappearing a second later right where they
     vanished is far more plausible than reappearing across the room
     nine minutes later. Modelled as independent exponential decays over
     elapsed time and over distance, tightened for short gaps (someone
     stepping out and immediately back) and loosened for longer ones
     (people move around during a real bathroom break).

MULTIPLE OBSERVATIONS, NOT ONE FRAME: each identity's fingerprint is a
rolling AVERAGE over its last several observations (not a single-frame
snapshot), so one noisy/blurry/oddly-lit frame can't define — or
misdefine — a person's signature. A brand-new, not-yet-matched track only
becomes eligible for matching once it has accumulated a minimum number of
observations itself.

CONSERVATIVE MERGING: matching uses a weighted fusion of whichever signals
are available, redistributing weight away from missing ones, and requires
the fused score to clear a high, configurable bar before two sightings are
called the same person. When evidence is weak or ambiguous — e.g. two
similarly-dressed choir members — the system creates a NEW identity rather
than guessing. An occasional extra ID from an over-cautious call is a much
smaller problem than merging two different people into one.

CAMERA CALIBRATION: since this runs against a fixed room camera, the
module learns an online running estimate of "expected bounding-box height
at this y-coordinate" from confirmed observations. This feeds the spatial
plausibility check (an implausible scale jump between two sightings claimed
to be the same person, at the same place, lowers confidence) and is also
exposed for the detection pipeline to use as an extra sanity check against
non-human false positives (see `expected_scale_at`).

PRIVACY: 100% local, nothing leaves this machine. No embeddings are
persisted to disk. Every fingerprint (appearance, shape, face, deep) is
deleted after `retention_seconds` of the person being out of frame, and
the entire gallery is wiped whenever a session/service ends (see
`reset()`). Before relying on this in production, confirm your venue's
notice/signage and applicable biometric-privacy rules (GDPR, Illinois'
BIPA, etc.) — this module makes it easy to disable (`enabled=False`) or
shorten retention further.
