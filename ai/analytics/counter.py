Kyro — Attendance Counter

Tracks live attendance metrics across one camera session.

Metrics:
- Current attendance (people inside now)
- Peak attendance (max at any single point)
- Total entries (cumulative people who entered)
- Total exits (cumulative people who left)
- Live occupancy percentage

Design decisions:
- Entry = a new track_id appears for the first time (confirmed state).
- Exit  = a previously seen track_id transitions to DELETED.
- Prevents double counting by maintaining a set of seen track IDs.

        Update counts from the latest set of confirmed tracks.

        Args:
            tracked_persons: Output of ByteTracker.update() — confirmed tracks only.
                Used for current_attendance/peak and to detect new entries.
            still_tracked_ids: Optional — ByteTracker.active_track_ids (CONFIRMED
                + LOST). When provided, exits are only counted once a track
                actually drops out of the tracker's memory, not merely out of
                the confirmed list — so a brief occlusion during ByteTrack's
                own grace period (max_age) isn't miscounted as a departure.
                If omitted, falls back to the confirmed-only behaviour.
            identity_map: Optional — track_id -> stable identity string, from
                FaceReId.resolve(). When a person leaves and returns, the
                tracker assigns a new track_id, but face re-id maps it back
                to the SAME identity string as before — so a returning
                person isn't counted as a new entry. If omitted, track_id
                is used directly (today's behaviour, pre-face-reid).

                IMPORTANT: FaceReId doesn't resolve a track's identity on
                its very first frame — it needs a few observations first,
                and returns a transient placeholder (f"track:{track_id}")
                in the meantime. This method treats current_ids/exits by
                raw track_id, and only consults identity_map once per
                track_id (when its entry is finalised) purely to decide
                whether it's a *return* of someone already seen — never to
                re-derive current_attendance or exits. That's deliberate:
                if a still-on-screen track's mapped identity later changes
                (placeholder → resolved, or resolved → a different match),
                that must never look like the original identity "exiting"
                while a new one "enters" — it's the same physical person,
                the whole time, on screen the whole time.
