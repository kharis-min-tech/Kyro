Kyro — Vision Pipeline

Orchestrates the full AI pipeline for one camera stream:
  Frame → Detection → Tracking → Seat Occupancy → Attendance Counter → Output

Design decisions:
- Single responsibility per module: pipeline only orchestrates, never detects/tracks itself.
- Output is a PipelineResult dataclass — clean interface for the backend to consume.
- Frame skipping is built in to maintain target FPS under load.
